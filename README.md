## COLAB Starter Theme.

This is a bones build based on the tools and templates that we at COLAB have decided to use. 

1.  [Lumberjack](https://lumberjack.rareloop.com/) - by Rareloop - a powerful MVC framework for modern WordPress Development. Lumberjack uses the [Timber framework](https://timber.github.io/docs/) and [Twig Templating](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/) to build easy to maintain, object oriented code. 
2.  [The TwentyTwentyOne](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyone/) - CSS theme system by [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
3.  [Timber ACF WP Blocks](https://github.com/palmiak/timber-acf-wp-blocks) - system for building custom blocks
4.  [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - For Bundling
5.  [Lando](https://lando.dev/) - For Local Development

The intention of this bare bones build is to be able to effect the colors, fonts, and a handful of global variables and have a working and usable block editor site. The Theme starts you off with base styles, a basic header, navigation, footer, mobile menu and basic page template.
